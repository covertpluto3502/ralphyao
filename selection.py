# How to use an 'if' statement
# if *condition*:
#     *code goes here*
# If the condition is true, the code within runs

# A true condition can be e.g 1 == 1 or 1 < 9
# But 1 == 2 is NOT true

# You should know a bit about operators...
# Try making these print "Hello world", only changing the ?

if 8 == 8:
    print("Hello world")
    
if 10 >= 8:
    print("Hello world")
    
if 2 < 8:
    print("Hello world")

if  != 3:
    print("Hello world")
