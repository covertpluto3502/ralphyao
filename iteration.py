# To do: learn to use for loops

# For loops allow you to repeat an instruction for a SET AMOUNT of times

# Example:

# for i in range(10):
#     print("Hello world")

# The for keyword shows that this is a FOR loop
# Ignore "i", "in" and "range" for now. All you need to know for now is how to use a FOR loop
# Remember to indent any lines inside the for loop. This way the computer knows it is inside the loop.

# Practice:

# Can you make this loop print "hi" for 10 times?

for i in range(5):
    print("hi")
    



# hint: replace number 5

# Can you create some code to print "hello" 100 times? Write it here:
